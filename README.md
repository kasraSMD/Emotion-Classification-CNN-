# Emotion Recognition using PyTorch

In this project, we aim to build a model that can recognize human emotions (e.g., anger, happiness, fear, etc.) from facial images. This provides an excellent opportunity to practice building and training a neural network using the **PyTorch** framework.

Additionally, we will explore how to utilize a pre-trained model in PyTorch and fine-tune its weights to adapt it to our custom dataset.

## Project Objectives

1. **Emotion Classification**: Train a model to classify emotions from facial images.
2. **End-to-End Model Building**: Learn how to design, implement, and train a neural network with PyTorch.
3. **Transfer Learning**: Use a pre-trained model for feature extraction and fine-tune it for emotion recognition.
4. **Hands-On PyTorch Practice**: Deepen understanding of PyTorch's data handling, model building, and training pipeline.

## Dataset

The dataset includes facial images labeled with corresponding emotions. Each sample represents a specific emotion class such as:

- **Anger**
- **Fear**
- **Sadness**
- **Happiness**
- **Disgust**
- **Surprise**
- **Neutral**
  
### Data Characteristics:
- **Image Format**: Grayscale
- **Emotion Classes**: 7 categories
- **Purpose**: Training, validation, and testing for emotion recogniti

You can use publicly available datasets like **FER2013** or any other suitable dataset.

## Tools and Techniques

- **PyTorch**: Framework for building and training the neural network.
- **Transfer Learning**: Use pre-trained models like ResNet, VGG, or MobileNet as a starting point.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Adapt pre-trained weights to our specific task.
- **Data Augmentation**: Apply transformations to improve model generalization.

## Steps to Build the Model

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset.
   - Split into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Apply data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and cropping.

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Use a pre-trained model from PyTorchâ€™s `torchvision.models`.
   - Replace the final layers with custom layers for emotion classification.

3. **Training**:
   - Define a loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss).
   - Use an optimizer like Adam.
   - Train the model and fine-tune the weights.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model on a test set.
   - Visualize predictions and analyze performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
